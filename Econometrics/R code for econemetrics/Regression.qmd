## Regression

state.x77: an R built-in data on economic and social characteristics of 50 states in the US as of 19771

```{r}

rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(extraDistr)
data <- as.data.frame(state.x77)

head(data, 4)
```

```{r}
dim(data)
```

Suppose we would like to know how illiteracy affects income (note: Income is a per-capita income).

Firstly, we visually check the relationship between these variables:

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Illiteracy, y = Income)) + geom_point()

```

From this figure, we can observe that there is a negative relationship between illiteracy and income, as expected.

Indeed, the (sample) correlation coefficient is

```{r}
with(data, cor(Illiteracy, Income))

#or

cor(data$Illiteracy, data$Income)
```
Using with() function we can omit the data$ part.

How much does an additional 1 point increase in illiteracy rate decrease the state’s income level, on average?

Here we assume a "model" that depicts the relationship between illiteracy and income:

$$Income = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Illiteracy + \epsilon$$

where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

Under this model, Illiteracy and Income have a linear relationship.

Since it is generally impossible that all observations are exactly on the straight line, we need an “error” term 𝜖 for adjustment.

We can answer to the above question by estimating the slope parameter $\beta_1$ from the data:

$Income + \beta_0 = \beta_1 \times Illiteracy + \epsilon$

We can estimate 𝛽1 by finding the best-fitting line to the data:

```{r}  
fit <- lm(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = data)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Illiteracy, y = Income)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red")

```
The estimated regression model (the red line in the figure) is

$$Income = 4951.3 - 440.6\times Illiteracy \ + error$$
Thus we can conclude that, on average, a 1% increase in illiteracy = 440.6 decrease in per-capita income.


## Formal definition of of Regression

Outcome variable of interest is the dependent variable, denoted by Y.

Variables that determine the value of the dependant variable are called explanatory variables, denoted by X.

The purpose of regression analysis is to estimate the relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables. Or as in notes to estimate a function 𝑔(⋅) of X that predicts the value of 𝑌 .

Linear regression model with a single explanatory variable:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X + \epsilon$$

where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

Multiple regression model with multiple explanatory variables:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X_1 + \beta_2 \times X_2 + \ldots + \beta_k \times X_k + \epsilon$$

where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_k$ are the slopes, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

Example 1:

A linear regression model of annual income:

$$Income = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Education + \beta_2 \times Experience + \epsilon$$

where Income is the dependent variable, Education and Experience are the explanatory variables, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

More formally:

$$\frac{\Delta{Income}}{\Delta{Education}} = \beta_1$$

Thus, $\beta_1$ is the change in Income for a one-unit change in Education, holding Experience constant.

Example 2:

A randomized experiment with binary treatment:

$$Outcome = \beta_0 + X \beta_1  + \epsilon$$
where $X = {0, 1}$ is the treatment variable.

Assume that $E(\epsilon) = 0$ <= Randomly assigning the treatment ensures this assumption.

Then the average treatment effect (ATE) is:

$$E(Outcome|X=1) - E(Outcome|X=0) = (\beta_0+\beta_1)-\beta_0 = \beta_1$$
”Linear” regression is a regression analysis based on a linear regression function:

$$g(X) = \beta_0 +X_1 \beta_1 + ... X_k\beta_k $$
One may consider a more general "nonlinear" regression model:

$$g(X) = (\beta_0 +X_1 \beta_1 + ... X_k\beta_k)^\alpha$$

```{r}
fit <- lm(Illiteracy ~ Illiteracy, data = data)



summary(fit)

ggplot(data, aes(x = `Life Exp`, y = Illiteracy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red")
