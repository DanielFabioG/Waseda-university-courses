## Research interest

I would like to research topics around finance.

Things around finance that interest me are:

- Financial markets
- Cryptocurrencies 
- Behavioral finance 

I am interested in the stock market, bond market, and cryptocurrencies and it is what got me into studying economics. Last year I had a course in behavioural economics and that got me interested in how people make financial decisions and how they can be influenced by psychological factors, which I found interesting.
