# Currencies and Exchange Rates: Definitions

## Different currencies

-   **Own currencies:** Countries with their own national currencies.
-   **Currencies with monetary union:** Examples include the European Union (EU) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union.
-   **Dollar or Euro fixed currencies:** Some countries peg their currency to the U.S. Dollar (USD) or Euro (EUR) at fixed ratios, which can vary.

## Different convertibility

-   **Full convertibility:** No restrictions on currency exchange, applicable to major currencies like USD, EUR, and JPY.
-   **Partial convertibility:** Some restrictions imposed by the government, as seen with the Chinese Yuan (CNY) and Indian Rupee (INR).

## Nominal Exchange Rate

The nominal exchange rate is the relative price of currencies.

\[ e = \frac{\text{Local Currency Units (LCU)}}{\text{Foreign Currency (USD)}} \]

The exchange rate can appreciate or depreciate based on the demand and supply of the foreign currency, and it may be influenced by central bank interventions.

## Real Exchange Rate (RER)

The real exchange rate represents the relative price of goods and services.

### Internal RER

\[ \text{RER} = \frac{P_t}{P_{nt}} \] Where: - $P_t$ = Price of tradable goods - $P_{nt}$ = Price of non-tradable goods

### External RER

\[ \text{RER} = \frac{e \cdot \text{WPI}_{\text{US}}}{\text{CPI}_{\text{LCU}}} \] Where: - $e$ = Nominal exchange rate - $\text{WPI}_{\text{US}}$ = Wholesale price index in the U.S. - $\text{CPI}_{\text{LCU}}$ = Consumer price index in the local currency

## Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)

$REER$ combines the exchange rate with trade policies, incorporating the effects of tariffs and subsidies on exports and imports.

## Effects of Trade Policies on Tradable Goods

-   **Imported goods with a tariff** $t_M$: \[ p_d = e \cdot p\^\* (1 + t_M) \] Where:
    -   $p_d$ = Domestic price
    -   $p^*$ = Foreign price
    -   $t_M$ = Import tariff rate
-   **Exported goods with an export tax** $t_E: [ p_d = e \cdot p^* (1 - t_E)$\] Where:
    -   $t_E$ = Export tax rate

## REER with Trade Policy Adjustments

-   **REER for imports:** \[ \text{REER}\_{\text{import}} = \text{RER} (1 + t_M - s_M) \] Where:
    -   $s_M$ = Import subsidy
-   **REER for exports:** \[ \text{REER}\_{\text{export}} = \text{RER} (1 - t_E + s_E) \] Where:
    -   $s_E$ = Export subsidy

# Why Exchange Regime Matters? Case of Export-Led Asian Economies (2)

## Dollar-Pegged Exchange Regime in East Asia

-   Virtually fixed exchange rate in East Asia (EA)
    -   The role of the U.S. market as an export absorber:
        -   Export income in USD ($), import payments in USD ($) or JPY (¥) (limited)
    -   Settlement in USD (\$) within EA, reducing exchange risks

## As the Bubble Economy Continued...

-   Overvaluation of the dollar-pegged exchange rate\
    → Weaker export competitiveness\
    → Rising risks for investors due to potential devaluation

-   Easy, cheap money from abroad\
    → Over-borrowing by banks and non-banks without proper supervisory (prudential regulations)\
    → Over-borrowing by firms, leading to private debt rather than sovereign debt, without proper corporate governance (debt disciplines)\
    ← Family business structures

-   Maturity mismatch by banks\
    → Borrowing short-term while issuing long-term loans/investments

-   Currency mismatch by banks\
    → Borrowing in USD (\$) while earning income in local currencies such as Baht, Rupiah, and Won

-   Failures in defending the pegged regime

## Official Development Assistance（ODA) AID, or “Economic Cooperation”

# Two-Gap Model for ODA

## Two Gaps Faced by Developing Countries

-   **Investment-Savings gap** and **Foreign Reserve gap**, based on the Chenery-Strout model.
-   Aid can cover both gaps through the national income identity:

\[ Y (\text{GNI}) = C + I + (X - M) \]

\[ Y = C + S \]

Since government spending ($G$) is excluded, the gaps can be expressed as:

\[ I - S \quad (\text{Saving gap}) = M - X \quad (\text{Forex gap}) \]

## Aid Classification

1.  **Grant:**
    -   No reimbursement required.
2.  **Concessional Loans:**
    -   High **Grant Element (GE)** ratio, which should exceed 25% compared to market allocation.\
    -   The formula for calculating the Grant Element is:

\[ GE = 100 \times \left( 1 - \frac{r}{d} \right) \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{1}{(1+d)^G} - \frac{1}{(1+d)^M} \right) \div \frac{M - G}{d} \right]\]

Where:\
- $r$ = reimbursing interest rate\
- $d$ = standard discount rate (typically 10%)\
- $G$ = grace period\
- $M$ = reimbursement period

-   The **GE** increases with a lower interest rate ($r$) and a longer discount period ($d$).

3.  **Technical Cooperation:**
    -   Includes expert dispatch and trainee programs.

# How to Offer Aid?

## Traditionally: Project Aid

-   Focuses on finding specific projects to assist with funding.

-   Covers different cost components:

    → **Investment costs** and **imported goods** provided by donors\
    (e.g., construction costs and foreign goods).

    → **Running costs** and **domestic goods** covered by recipients\
    (domestic goods do not pose exchange rate risks).

## Debt Problems in the 1980s → Shift to Non-Project (Program) Assistance

-   Aimed at addressing debt repayment challenges.\
-   Example: **Structural Adjustment Lending (SAL)** with conditionalities to build capacity for debt reimbursement.

Key features of program assistance:\
\* Controlling domestic currency issues.\
\* Quick disbursement compared to project aid, as it does not require extensive estimation for domestic procedures.

# Fungibility and Governance in ODA

## Fungibility Issues

-   The success of **program assistance** depends on how the funds are utilized.

-   **Fungibility problems** arise when ODA (Official Development Assistance) is used for unintended purposes, such as **military expansion**, instead of the intended development goals.

    → **Solution:** Common monitoring mechanisms to track expenditures and ensure proper allocation.

## Good Governance and Aid Effectiveness

-   Effective governance requires an efficient government, involving both politicians and bureaucrats.

    → Efforts to combat corruption are crucial for aid success.\
    → The effectiveness of aid has been widely debated:

    -   **Burnside & Dollar (2000):** Aid contributes to economic growth when governance is strong and effective.\
    -   **Easterly (2006):** The primary issue lies in how aid is utilized rather than the amount of aid provided.

## Aid Bombardment and Coordination

-   **Aid bombardment** refers to implementation constraints and costs arising from overly complicated aid structures.

    → To address this, aid coordination efforts led by organizations such as **OECD-DAC** aim to streamline processes and reduce costs.

# Japan’s ODA

## Overview

-   Traditionally a major donor, holding the position of **No.1 donor from 1983 to 2000**, but gradually declining to **No.4** in the 2000s.

-   Despite being a major donor, Japan’s ODA expenditure relative to GDP remains lower than the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) goal:

    \[ \text{DAC goal: } 0.7% \quad \> \quad \text{Japan's contribution: } 0.2% \]

## Basic Characteristics

1.  **First non-Western DAC member:**
    -   Japan was the first country outside the Western bloc to join the DAC, bringing a unique perspective to development assistance.
2.  **Unique Presence:**
    -   Japan's aid has been influenced by its history, serving as **war-time compensation** for Asian countries.
    -   Japanese aid is characterized by a preference for **loans over grants** and a **request-based approach**, meaning recipient countries play a larger role in aid decisions.
    -   Japan follows a more neutral approach compared to Western donors:\
        → **Weaker human rights fundamentalism** compared to the EU.\
        → **Weaker democracy promotion** compared to the US.\
        → Focus on an "ownership approach," allowing recipient countries to take the lead.
3.  **Commercialism?:**
    -   Japanese aid often acts as a **vanguard for foreign direct investment (FDI)** and trade expansion, aligning with Japan's economic interests.
4.  **Technology Cooperation:**
    -   Strong emphasis on **hardware-oriented** assistance, focusing on sectors such as civil engineering and agriculture.\
    -   Japan also provides **software** support, but hardware remains the priority.

# New Challenges for ODA

## Emergence of New Donors (2000s–Present)

-   The landscape of ODA has evolved with the entry of **new donors** outside the DAC framework, including:

    -   **China:**
        -   Through initiatives such as the **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)** and the **Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)**.\
    -   **India:** Expanding its influence in development aid.
    -   **Middle Eastern countries:** Increasing contributions to global aid.
    -   **Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** Providing alternative forms of development assistance.

-   These new donors bring **different perspectives** on development but pose challenges in **coordination** with traditional donors, especially regarding adherence to standards such as:

    → **Environmental regulations**\
    → **Human rights protection**

## Fiscal Constraints Faced by Traditional Donors

Traditional donors are seeking innovative financial mechanisms to overcome budgetary constraints, including:

-   **United Kingdom (UK):**
    -   Implementing **Future Flow Securitization**, which involves issuing bonds based on future investment returns.
-   **France:**
    -   Introducing the **Tobin Tax**, a financial transaction tax aimed at funding development projects.
-   **United States (US):**
    -   Establishing the **Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)** to provide aid to least developed countries (LDCs) that demonstrate good governance.\
    -   Promoting **Base of the Pyramid (BOP) business** models to encourage private sector involvement in development.

# Who is Responsible for Environmental Degradation?

## The Richest vs. The Poorest: A Complex Relationship

The responsibility for environmental degradation is often attributed to both the richest and the poorest segments of society, but the relationship is more complex. There exists a **bidirectional link** between poverty and environmental degradation, where:

-   **Poverty leads to environmental degradation**, and\
-   **Environmental degradation exacerbates poverty.**

### How Poverty Leads to Environmental Degradation

1.  **Overexploitation of Natural Resources:**
    -   The poor often rely directly on natural resources (e.g., forests, fisheries, arable land) for survival.\
    -   Due to lack of alternatives, they may engage in deforestation, overfishing, or unsustainable agricultural practices, leading to resource depletion.
2.  **Lack of Access to Sustainable Practices:**
    -   Limited financial and technological resources prevent the adoption of environmentally friendly methods.\
    -   The absence of education and awareness about conservation further worsens the situation.
3.  **Urbanization and Informal Settlements:**
    -   Rapid rural-to-urban migration driven by poverty results in unplanned settlements, leading to pollution, waste mismanagement, and increased pressure on local ecosystems.
4.  **Short-Term Survival Needs:**
    -   Immediate survival takes precedence over long-term environmental sustainability, resulting in unsustainable practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture and illegal logging.

### How Environmental Degradation Exacerbates Poverty

1.  **Loss of Livelihoods:**
    -   Degraded environments reduce agricultural productivity, fishery yields, and access to clean water, pushing communities further into poverty.
2.  **Health Impacts:**
    -   Pollution, deforestation, and water scarcity contribute to health problems, increasing healthcare costs and reducing labor productivity.
3.  **Natural Disasters and Climate Vulnerability:**
    -   Poor communities often live in disaster-prone areas with limited resilience, making them highly vulnerable to climate change effects such as floods, droughts, and soil erosion.
4.  **Increased Costs of Living:**
    -   Resource depletion leads to rising costs of food, water, and energy, disproportionately affecting the poor.

### The Role of the Richest in Environmental Degradation

1.  **High Consumption Patterns:**
    -   Wealthier individuals and nations have high carbon footprints due to energy-intensive lifestyles, excessive consumption, and demand for luxury goods.
2.  **Industrial Pollution:**
    -   Large-scale industries, often owned or supported by the wealthiest, contribute significantly to pollution through emissions, waste disposal, and deforestation.
3.  **Global Supply Chains:**
    -   Demand for raw materials and cheap labor drives unsustainable practices in developing regions, further deepening environmental degradation.
4.  **Exporting Environmental Costs:**
    -   Richer countries often outsource pollution-intensive industries to poorer regions, leading to environmental harm without immediate local consequences.

### Addressing the Issue

-   **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):** Policies need to balance economic development with environmental protection.\
-   **Inclusive Policies:** Ensuring access to clean technology, education, and fair economic opportunities for the poor.\
-   **Corporate Responsibility:** Encouraging sustainable production and ethical sourcing in global supply chains.\
-   **International Cooperation:** Richer nations must support sustainable initiatives in developing countries through technology transfer and fair trade practices.

The relationship between wealth and environmental degradation is intricate, requiring a holistic approach to achieve sustainable development without exacerbating poverty.

# Addressing Externalities: Achieving Social Optimum Production

## Problem Statement

-   **Price signals** often lead individual producers to produce at $q^* < q_C$, where $q_C$ represents the socially optimal production level.
-   When externalities exist, market failure occurs, leading to **excess production** and **excess pollution**.
-   The challenge is to align private production levels with the social optimum ($q^* = q_C$).

## Possible Policy Interventions

1.  **Output or Externality Tax for Polluters (Pigouvian Tax):**
    -   Introduces a tax on output or the externality itself to internalize the social cost.\
    -   Encourages producers to reduce production to the socially efficient level.\
    -   Example: Carbon tax on emissions.
2.  **Output Reduction Subsidies:**
    -   If polluters have the right to pollute, governments can provide subsidies to incentivize output reduction.\
    -   Reduces the economic burden on polluters while achieving environmental goals.
3.  **Output or Pollution Quota (Command-and-Control Approach):**
    -   Government sets legal limits on the amount of output or pollution a producer can generate.\
    -   Strict enforcement and monitoring are required to ensure compliance.\
    -   Example: Emission limits for factories.
4.  **Pollution Permits Trade (Cap-and-Trade Approach):**
    -   A market-based solution where a total pollution cap is set, and permits are allocated or auctioned.\
    -   Firms can trade permits, allowing more efficient polluters to sell excess allowances to others.\
    -   Encourages cost-effective pollution reduction.
5.  **Institutional Change in Producer Organization (Unitization or Cooperation):**
    -   Encouraging firms to collaborate in production or resource management to internalize externalities collectively.\
    -   Example: Joint initiatives for sustainable resource use in the agricultural sector.
6.  **Private Negotiations Among Parties (Coase Theorem):**
    -   If property rights are well-defined and transaction costs are low, private parties can negotiate solutions to externalities.\
    -   Leads to efficient outcomes without government intervention.\
    -   Example: Affected parties compensating polluters to reduce emissions.

Each policy has advantages and limitations, and the choice of intervention depends on factors such as enforceability, administrative capacity, and economic efficiency.

# Major Policy Responses: Tax

## (1) Output or Externality Tax for Polluters (If No Property Rights for Polluters)

-   When polluters do not have property rights, the government can impose a tax equal to the social cost to internalize the externality.
-   The tax amount is set to **BF**, where the price adjustment leads to a shift from the market price ($p^*$) to the socially optimal price ($p_p$).
-   As a result, production decreases from point **F** and consumption contracts to point **B**.

### Welfare Implications:

-   **Consumer Surplus (CS):**\
    \[ -1 - 2 \< 0 \] Consumers experience a net loss due to higher prices and lower consumption.

-   **Producer Surplus (PS):**\
    \[ -3 - 4 \< 0 \] Producers face a net loss due to reduced production and higher compliance costs.

-   **Government Revenue (G):**\
    \[ +1 + 3 \> 0 \] The government collects tax revenue, leading to a positive fiscal impact.

-   **Pollution Reduction:**\
    \[ +2 + 4 + 5 \] Reduction in pollution generates social benefits, contributing to overall welfare.

### Net Social Gain:

\[ 5 \]

The policy results in a net social welfare improvement, represented by area **5**, even though pollution is not entirely eliminated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Observations:

1.  **No Full Pollution Elimination:**
    -   The policy does not completely remove pollution; rather, it reduces the production of polluting goods.
2.  **Distributional Effects:**
    -   Consumers and producers incur losses, while the government benefits through tax revenues.
3.  **Government Efficiency Concerns:**
    -   The success of this intervention depends on whether the government is "wise enough" to utilize the collected revenue effectively and fairly.

This approach underscores the balance between environmental goals and economic impacts, highlighting the challenge of designing effective and fair environmental taxation policies.

# Major Policy Responses: Subsidies

## (2) Output Reduction Subsidies (If Property Rights for Polluters Exist)

-   When polluters hold property rights, governments can introduce **output reduction subsidies** to encourage lower production levels and reduce pollution.
-   The subsidy amount is set equal to $(p^* - p_p)$, leading to a shift in production to point **F** and consumption to point **B**.

### Welfare Implications:

-   **Consumer Surplus (CS):**\
    \[ -1 - 2 \< 0 \] Consumers experience a net loss due to changes in market dynamics.

-   **Producer Surplus (PS):**\
    \[ (+1 - 4) + (2 + 4 + 5a + 6) \> 0 \] Producers gain from the subsidy, as it compensates them for reduced production and provides additional financial incentives.

-   **Government Revenue (G):**\
    \[

    -   (2 + 4 + 5a + 6) \< 0 \] The government incurs a significant fiscal cost due to subsidy payments.

-   **Pollution Reduction:**\
    \[ +2 + 4 + 5 \] Pollution is reduced, leading to an improvement in social welfare.

### Net Social Gain:

\[ 5 \]

The policy results in a net social welfare improvement of **5**, similar to the tax approach.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Observations:

1.  **Highly Attractive Solution for Producers:**
    -   Producers benefit from the subsidies, making it an appealing policy from their perspective.
2.  **Potential for Market Distortion:**
    -   The availability of subsidies might **attract new polluters**, potentially offsetting the environmental benefits.
3.  **High Fiscal Burden on Government:**
    -   Subsidies are **costly for the government**, requiring significant budget allocations and potentially leading to inefficiencies.

This policy highlights the trade-offs between incentivizing pollution reduction and the fiscal sustainability of such measures.

# Major Policy Responses: Quota

## (3) Restricting Output to a Quota (Command-and-Control Approach)

-   Under the **Command-and-Control** approach, the government sets a production quota at level **F**, with consumption adjusted to point **B**.\
-   This policy directly limits production quantities to achieve the socially optimal outcome.

### Welfare Implications:

-   **Consumer Surplus (CS):**\
    \[ -1 - 2 \< 0 \] Consumers experience a net loss due to higher prices and reduced consumption.

-   **Producer Surplus (PS):**\
    \[ (+1 - 4) \quad \text{generally} \> 0 \] Producers benefit compared to the taxation approach, as they can capitalize on the market scarcity created by the quota, leading to higher prices.

-   **Government (G):**\
    \[ 0 \quad \text{(no change)} \] The government does not gain or lose directly unless quotas are auctioned.

-   **Pollution Reduction:**\
    \[ +2 +4 +5 \] Effective reduction of pollution due to restricted production.

### Net Social Gain:

\[ 5 \]

The overall social welfare improves by **5**, similar to other approaches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Observations:

1.  **Attractive for Producers:**
    -   The quota creates market scarcity, allowing producers to benefit from higher prices.\
    -   This effect is especially pronounced in markets with **inelastic demand**, such as gasoline.
2.  **Government vs. Producer Interests:**
    -   The government may prefer taxation, which generates revenue, while producers favor quotas, which allow them to benefit from higher prices without direct financial outflows.
3.  **Quota Auctioning Opportunity:**
    -   The government can auction quotas, allowing producers to bid up to a level where the quota price cancels out their extra market gains.\
    -   This can generate government revenue while maintaining environmental objectives.

This policy presents a trade-off between regulatory control, market efficiency, and government revenue potential.

# Major Policy Responses: Private Negotiations (Coase Theorem)

## Scenario 1: Polluter Has the Right to Pollute

### Initial Condition:

-   **Polluter welfare:**\
    \[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \]
-   **Pollutee welfare:**\
    \[ -3 - 4 - 5 - 6 \]
-   **Social welfare:**\
    \[ (1 + 2) - (5 + 6) \]

### After Negotiation:

-   **Pollution will continue, and the outcome will be:**
    -   **Polluter welfare:**\
        \[ (1 + 2 + 3) + (4 + 5) \quad \text{(gains 5)} \]
    -   **Pollutee welfare:**\
        \[ -3 - (4 + 5) \>

## Lecture 12: Institutions for Development

# What Are Institutions and Why Do They Matter in Development? (1): NIE Contributions

## Definition of Institutions

-   **Douglas North:**
    -   Institutions are the **rules of the game** in a society.\
    -   They provide **incentives** that shape human behavior in their interactions.
-   **Masahiko Aoki:**
    -   Institutions are the **equilibrium results** that emerge from strategic interactions in societal "games."

## New Institutional Economics (NIE)

-   NIE focuses on the role of institutions in addressing **information asymmetry** and related market failures, such as:
    -   **Adverse selection** (hidden information problems).\
    -   **Moral hazard** (hidden action problems).\
    -   **Transaction costs** (barriers to market efficiency).
-   **Institutional innovation** plays a critical role in development by facilitating market efficiency and reducing uncertainties.
    -   Example: **Market-enhancing views**, which advocate for well-functioning institutions to support market operations.

### Contributions to the Market Economy

1.  **Influencing Market Interactions:**
    -   Institutions shape the behavior of producers and consumers, creating a structured environment for economic activities.
2.  **Reducing Transaction Costs:**
    -   Lower transaction costs enable:\
        ➯ Greater specialization and division of labor.\
        ➯ Productivity gains and economic growth.

    -   Examples of critical institutions include:\
        ➯ **Property rights:** Secure ownership encourages investment and innovation.\
        ➯ **Contract enforcement:** Ensures trust and reduces risk in transactions.

### Institutional Quality and Economic Development

-   **Properly functioning institutions:**
    -   Promote transactions and economic development by ensuring fairness, transparency, and efficiency.
-   **Weak or exploitative institutions:**
    -   Increase transaction costs and discourage economic activity.\
    -   Example: Government exploitation, corruption, or failure to enforce property rights.

Effective institutions are fundamental to foste

# What Are Institutions and Why They Matter in Development (3)

## Institutional Darwinism: Survival of the Fittest?

-   The idea that **dominating institutions** survive over time, similar to biological evolution.\
-   However, the **survival of institutions** does not always guarantee **social efficiency**, as they may only serve the interests of certain stakeholders.\
-   Example: **Sharecropping**, which is beneficial for risk-sharing but often leads to inefficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Sharecropping System

In agricultural economies, sharecropping is a prevalent institutional arrangement where:

-   **Principal:** Landlord (owns the land and rents it to the tenant).\

-   **Agent:** Tenant (works on the land and pays rent to the landlord).\

-   **Renting Systems:**

    1.  **Wage Contract:**
        -   Tenant is paid a fixed wage regardless of output.\
        -   Incentives for effort are low, leading to potential inefficiency.
    2.  **Fixed-Rent Contract:**
        -   Tenant pays a predetermined amount ($R$) to the landlord.\
        -   Strong incentives for effort, but higher risk borne by the tenant.
    3.  **Sharecropping Contract:**
        -   Tenant and landlord share the output in a fixed ratio ($r$).\
        -   Balances risk and effort incentives but often leads to inefficiencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Puzzle of Sharecropping: Marshallian Inefficiency

-   According to **Marshallian inefficiency**, sharecropping results in suboptimal effort because:
    -   The tenant does not receive the full benefit of their labor (only a fraction $r$ of the output), leading to **reduced work effort**.\
    -   This creates an **inefficiency problem**, as the total output is lower compared to fixed-rent or wage contracts.

### Trade-Offs in Sharecropping:

1.  **Risk Sharing:**
    -   Beneficial for tenants who cannot bear full production risks.
2.  **Efficiency Loss:**
    -   Effort levels are lower than socially optimal due to the lack of full ownership of returns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Insights:

-   **Institutional arrangements may persist even if they are not the most efficient option** due to historical, social, and risk-related factors.\
-   **Institutions evolve not necessarily to maximize efficiency but to balance power dynamics, risks, and incentives among stakeholders.**\
-   Policymakers must carefully consider institutional structures and their long-term implications for development.
